# noswfupload

A fork of the famous NOSWFUPLOAD JavaScript library for multiple file uploads on the browser.

## About

This project was created in 2009 by _Andrea Giammarchi_. It supported the older versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari. However, newer version of Chrome (52+), Opera (15+), Firefox (44+) have problems with it as the library throws errors. However, this version of the codebase supports both older and newer versions in a better way.
